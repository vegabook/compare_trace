  2. If :timex is a dependency, make sure it is listed under "def deps" in your mix.exs

  3. In case you don't want to add a requirement to :timex, you may optionally skip this warning by adding [xref: [exclude: [Timex]]] to your "def project" in mix.exs

We will inject a default implementation for now:

    def init(init_arg) do
      {:ok, init_arg}

You can copy the implementation above or define your own that converts the arguments given to GenServer.start_link/3 to the server state.

  2. If :timex is a dependency, make sure it is listed under "def deps" in your mix.exs

  3. In case you don't want to add a requirement to :timex, you may optionally skip this warning by adding [xref: [exclude: [Timex]]] to your "def project" in mix.exs
